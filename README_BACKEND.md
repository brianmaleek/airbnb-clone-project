## üóÇÔ∏è Database Design

### Key Entities and Relationships

1. **User**
   - Represents both property owners and guests.
   - Fields: id, email, password_hash, first_name, last_name, created_at
   - Relationships:
     - One-to-Many with Properties (a user can own multiple properties)
     - One-to-Many with Bookings (a user can make multiple bookings)
     - One-to-Many with Reviews (a user can write multiple reviews)

2. **Property**
   - Represents a property listed on the platform.
   - Fields: id, title, description, price_per_night, location, amenities, owner_id
   - Relationships:
     - Many-to-One with User (belongs to an owner)
     - One-to-Many with Bookings (can have multiple bookings)
     - One-to-Many with Reviews (can have multiple reviews)

3. **Booking**
   - Represents a reservation made by a user for a property.
   - Fields: id, property_id, user_id, start_date, end_date, total_price, status
   - Relationships:
     - Many-to-One with Property (belongs to a property)
     - Many-to-One with User (belongs to a guest)
     - One-to-One with Payment (has one payment)

4. **Review**
   - Represents feedback left by a user for a property.
   - Fields: id, property_id, user_id, rating, comment, created_at
   - Relationships:
     - Many-to-One with Property (belongs to a property)
     - Many-to-One with User (belongs to a reviewer)

5. **Payment**
   - Represents a financial transaction related to a booking.
   - Fields: id, booking_id, amount, payment_method, status, transaction_id
   - Relationships:
     - One-to-One with Booking (belongs to a booking)

### Database Schema Overview

The database follows a relational model where:

- Users can be either property owners or guests
- Properties are owned by users and can be booked by other users
- Bookings connect users with properties for specific date ranges
- Reviews allow users to rate and comment on properties they've stayed at
- Payments are associated with bookings to track financial transactions

This structure ensures data integrity while maintaining flexibility for the various operations required by the Airbnb clone platform.
